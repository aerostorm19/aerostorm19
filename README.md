# Hi, I'm Abhijit.
In India, friends know me as ‚ÄúAbhi‚Äù (short and simple, like the code I try to write).

Electronics & Telecommunication engineer in the making with a passion for embedded systems, FPGA design, and AI-powered security. I love building at the edge of hardware and software whether that‚Äôs shaping RISC-V CPUs, crafting SDR pipelines, or engineering systems that scale from lab prototypes to real-world impact.

## üìñ About Me

I‚Äôm a 3rd-year Electronics & Telecommunication student at the Army Institute of Technology, Pune an AITian who enjoys building things at the intersection of circuits, code, and curiosity. My research and project interests span embedded systems, FPGA design, computer architecture, and AI-driven cybersecurity.

Before university, I was that kid pulling apart gadgets just to see how they worked (and sometimes, struggling to put them back together). That curiosity grew into a love for engineering: from designing STM32-based control stacks for autonomous drones to experimenting with SDR pipelines and even tinkering with RISC-V CPUs.

Somewhere along the way, I realized I wasn‚Äôt just passionate about solving problems on a breadboard or in Verilog I loved seeing how these technical experiments could scale into real-world impact. That‚Äôs what pushed me to projects like our Smart India Hackathon finalist system for predicting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, or my work on ML-based intrusion prevention.

Beyond the lab, I‚Äôve served as Embedded Lead at CEAR Robotics Club, leading drone and robot control design, and as Joint Secretary of OSS Club & E-Cell, where I helped run Innerve Hackathon (4,000+ participants) and launched Startup Saga with a team of dreamers and builders.

When I‚Äôm not soldering, debugging, or writing another for loop at 2 a.m., you‚Äôll probably find me sketching concept art, hooping on the basketball court, or planning the next project that blends tech with purpose.

I like to think of myself as someone who bridges worlds: core electronics and full-stack software, problem-solving and storytelling, engineering and impact.
