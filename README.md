# Hi, I'm Abhijit.
In India, friends know me as ‚ÄúAbhi‚Äù (short and simple, like the code I try to write).

Electronics & Telecommunication engineer in the making with a passion for embedded systems, FPGA design, and AI-powered security. I love building at the edge of hardware and software whether that‚Äôs shaping RISC-V CPUs, crafting SDR pipelines, or engineering systems that scale from lab prototypes to real-world impact.

## üìñ About Me

I‚Äôm a 3rd-year Electronics & Telecommunication student at the Army Institute of Technology, Pune an AITian who loves building things where circuits, code, and curiosity meet. My interests lie in embedded systems, FPGA design, computer architecture, and AI-driven cybersecurity.

Ever since I was a kid pulling apart gadgets to see how they worked, I‚Äôve been passionate about engineering. I‚Äôve worked on projects like STM32-based drone control, SDR pipelines, and RISC-V CPUs. More than solving problems, I enjoy creating solutions that make an impact‚Äîlike predicting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods or building ML-based intrusion prevention systems.

Beyond engineering, I‚Äôve led teams at CEAR Robotics, OSS Club, and E-Cell. When I‚Äôm not debugging at 2 a.m., you‚Äôll find me sketching, playing basketball, or planning my next project.

I enjoy bridging hardware and software, creativity and logic, experimentation and real-world impact.
